## Installation

The openrouteservice client requires **nodejs** and a valid **Api-Key** to access the openrouteservice API. Also make sure that **git** is installed. 

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
- [Api-key](https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/)

### Permission Issues
If you encounter any [permission issues](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/18380) during the installation:

- *on Linux:* try running npm-commands with `sudo` :

e.g.:
```sh
sudo npm install
```
- *on Windows([GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) recommended):* try running npm-commands with the `--no-optional` flag:

e.g.:
```sh
npm install --no-optional
```

### Step by Step instructions

- Download openrouteservice repository:
```sh
# clone repository from github
git clone https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice-app.git

# switch to repository folder
cd openrouteservice-app
```

- Install dependencies:
```sh
# install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json
npm install

# install dependencies listed in bower.json
npx bower install
```

- Install required modules for slider layout:

*(This step is for layout purposes only. If you want to skip it remove `grunt:sliderMakeCss` from the task queue in the renamed `Gruntfile.js` [see next step])*
```sh
# Switch to bower_components/angular folder:
cd bower_components/angularjs-slider

# install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json
npm install

# switch back to openrouteservice-app folder:
cd ../..
```

- Initiate default files:
```sh
# Copy `Gruntfile.default.js` to `Gruntfile.js`
cp Gruntfile.default.js Gruntfile.js

# Copy `weathercheck.default.txt` to `weathercheck.txt`.
cp app/weathercheck.default.txt app/weathercheck.txt
```

- Replace weathercheck.txt content with your Api-Key:
```sh
# Finally open `app/weathercheck.txt` in your favorite text editor and replace the content with your Token.
# e.g.:
vim app/weathercheck.txt
```

## Run openrouteservice:	

For the standard openrouteservice version do:

	npx grunt ors

If you want to use the openrouteservice client with a [local backend version of openrouteservice](https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice) you have to adjust the *endpoint paths* to the *backend war version* you are using in `Grunfile.js`.

Afterwards do:

	npx grunt ors_local
